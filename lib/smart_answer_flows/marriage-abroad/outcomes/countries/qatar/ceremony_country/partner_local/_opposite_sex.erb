Contact the relevant local authorities in Qatar to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^There are no civil marriages in Qatar, but you can get married through a religious ceremony at a church or Sharia court.^

You may be able to get married at the British Embassy if you’re both resident in Qatar and can prove that there are no other suitable facilities to get married locally.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry. This is called a marital status document.

[Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Qatar](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-doha/marital-status-document/slot_picker) to get a marital status document. You’ll need:

- your passport
- a copy of your partner’s passport
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

If you have dual nationality and entered Qatar on your non-British passport, you’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit from the embassy of that country.

Your partner will also need to swear an affirmation or affidavit if they’re British. If they’re not, they might need an equivalent document from their embassy.

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time of the divorce.^

If your documents aren’t in English, you’ll need to bring [certified translations](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) as well as the originals.

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) into the local language and ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

##Get married at the British embassy

You may be able to get married at the British embassy if you and your partner live in Qatar and are not Muslim. You will need to prove that there are no other suitable facilities to get married locally. 

Contact the [British embassy in Qatar](/world/organisations/british-embassy-doha/office/british-embassy-doha-main-contact) for more information.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
