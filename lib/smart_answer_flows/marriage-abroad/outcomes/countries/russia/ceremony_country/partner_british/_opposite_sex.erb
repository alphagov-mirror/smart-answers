Contact the relevant local authorities in Russia to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

If you need a CNI, you’ll first need to give notice of your intended marriage at the embassy.

###Applying for a CNI from the consulate

You’ll need to have been living in the Russian Federation for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, for example if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

You can then book an appointment at the embassy to give notice of your marriage.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Moscow.](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-moscow/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker)

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of your address in Russia
- equivalent documents for your partner

You’ll need to complete: 

- a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form 
- an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form
- a [payment authorisation form](/government/publications/russia-consular-fees)

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll). The Russian spelling of your name needs to be the same on all your Russian language documents - if not, the authorities may not accept your documents.%

^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You may need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English or Russian.^

###What happens next

The embassy or notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath.

If you give notice at a notary public, you must get a [certified translation](/government/publications/russia-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) of your forms into English. Post the forms and any supporting documents to the British embassy afterwards. You will need to get a courier to return your documents to you.

Your notice of marriage will be displayed publicly for 7 days at the embassy. 

They’ll then issue your CNI on the eighth day (as long as nobody has registered an objection). This costs £50.

^You do not need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^

You need to get your CNI [certified by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Legalisation Department](https://www.kdmid.ru/consr.aspx?lst=cnslfunkrf&it=/%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%20-%20%D0%98%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%20%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B5.aspx) before presenting it to the Russian marriage registrar.
