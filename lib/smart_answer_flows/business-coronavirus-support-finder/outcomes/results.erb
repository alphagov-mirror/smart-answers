    ### Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme

    If you are an employer with a PAYE scheme, you should be able to access support to continue paying part of your employees' salary instead of laying them off.

    This applies to employees who have been asked to stop working because of coronavirus, but are being kept on the payroll. They are known as ‘furloughed workers’. HMRC will pay 80% of their wages, up to £2,500 per month.

    You must have agreed with your employee to put them on furlough by 10 June 2020. You must claim wages for your furloughed employee by 31 July 2020.

    If you are due to pay a Self Assessment payment on account by 31 July 2020, you can defer payment up until January 2021. You will not be charged any interest or penalties during the deferral period.

    You do not need to be self-employed to be eligible for the deferment.

    The deferment is optional. If you are still able to pay your second payment on 31 July, you should do so.

    This is an automatic offer. You do not need to apply for the deferral, or tell HMRC. If you normally pay by Direct Debit you should contact your bank to cancel your Direct Debit as soon as you can. You do not need to contact HMRC before doing this.
