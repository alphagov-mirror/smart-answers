  Find out which UK benefits you might be able to get while you're abroad and how to claim them.

  The UK has social security agreements with some countries that:

  - allow you to claim some benefits while you're there
  - mean that your National Insurance contributions can count towards your eligibility for that country's benefits

  It's easier to organise benefits before you leave.

  ^You must meet the benefit's eligibility criteria to get it.^
