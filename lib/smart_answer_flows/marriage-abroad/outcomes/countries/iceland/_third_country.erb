##Before you start

You must contact the District Commissioner (‘Sýslumaðurinn’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need. Under Icelandic law District Commissioners make their own decisions about the documents needed.

^You should get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Iceland](/foreign-travel-advice/iceland) before making any plans.^

##Prove you’re free to get married

You may need to get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re legally allowed to get married or a ‘no trace’ letter from the General Register Office in the UK.

If a CNI is required you should check whether the District Commissioner will accept one issued in:

- [the UK](/marriage-abroad/y/iceland/uk)
- [Iceland](/marriage-abroad/y/iceland/ceremony_country)


*[CNI]:Certificate of no impediment
