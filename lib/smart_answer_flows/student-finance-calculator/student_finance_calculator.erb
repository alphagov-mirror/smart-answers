  + 2019 to 2020
  + 2020 to 2021

  Use the student finance calculator to estimate:

  + student loans
  + extra student funding, for example if you’re disabled or have children

  Your result will be more accurate if you know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).

  If you’re a part-time student you’ll need to know how many credits you’ll study and how many credits a full-time student would study.

  You cannot use the calculator if you’re from [Scotland](http://www.saas.gov.uk/), [Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk) or [Northern Ireland.](http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk)
