## Prove you're free to get married 

What you need varies across Spain.

If you're getting married in Barcelona city and applying to the Central Civil Registry, you'll need a [marital status certificate](/government/publications/marital-status-example). 

If you're getting married elsewhere, the civil registry office will ask for one or both of the following:

- a certificate of no impediment (CNI)
- a marital status certificate

You can either get a CNI in:

- [the UK](/marriage-abroad/y/spain/uk/opposite_sex)
- [Spain](/marriage-abroad/y/spain/ceremony_country/opposite_sex)

^You might be able to form a civil partnership. Check the local rules with the [British embassy](/world/organisations/british-embassy-madrid).
*[CNI]: certificate of no impediment
