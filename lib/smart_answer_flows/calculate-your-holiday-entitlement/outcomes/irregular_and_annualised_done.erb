  The statutory holiday entitlement is <%= holiday_entitlement %> weeks holiday.

  There are no regulations on how to convert the entitlement into days or hours for workers with irregular hours.

  You may wish to [use the calculator again](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement/y) and calculate the average days or hours worked each week based on a representative reference period instead.

  <%= render partial: 'your_employer_with_rounding' %>

  <% if holiday_period == 'starting' %>
    <%= render partial: 'irregular_and_annualised_user_awareness' %>
  <% else %>
    <%= render partial: 'entitlement_restriction' %>
  <% end %>
