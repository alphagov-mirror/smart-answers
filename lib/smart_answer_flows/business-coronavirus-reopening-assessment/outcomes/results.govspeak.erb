    ## Record your risk assessment

    You need to write down the findings of your risk assessment, including:

    - things that can harm staff and other people on site
    - who could be harmed and how
    - what you’re doing about it

    Staff can help you do the risk assessment.

    The health and safety executive (HSE) has a [risk assessment template](https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm) and [more information on how to carry out a risk assessment](https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/steps-needed-to-manage-risk.htm).

    ## Customers, visitors and contractors on site

    Managing the number of people:

    - explain social distancing on site when visitors arrive (you can also use signs)
    - limit number of visitors or customers at any one time so people can social distance
    - contractors should only be on site when it’s essential
    - keep contact with contractors to a minimum
    - keep a record of visitors if you can
    - people who host visitors should be clear on social distancing rules on site

    Signs:

    - put up signs to stay 2 meters apart when on site
    - if rights of way cross your premises, put up signs to remind the public of social distancing
    - have 2 meter floor markings for queues

    ## Your employees travel for work

    You should:

    - only travel for essential work
    - have fixed groups of people travelling so that any contact happens between the same people
    - clean company vehicles between shifts
    - make sure accommodation meets social distancing guidelines
    - keep a log of who is staying where

    ## You receive and send goods

    You should:

    - minimise contact at drop-off and collection
    - minimise contact when people pay for or exchange things, for example by using contactless and electronically signed documents
    - minimise contact at security, yard and warehouse
    - minimise the frequency of deliveries, for example by ordering larger amounts at a time
    - have single workers load or unload vehicles where it’s safe
    - where you need more people for loading have fixed pairs or teams
    - encourage drivers to stay in the vehicle where it’s safe
