    You can also study with a [British National Overseas (BNO) visa](/guidance/hong-kong-british-national-overseas-visa-applications/). Unlike other study visas, you can:

    + apply without an offer of a place on a course
    + change your course or start a new one without telling the Home Office
    + settle permanently in the UK after 5 years
