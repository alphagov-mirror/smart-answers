    ## Get help to work from home
    Your employer should help you work from home by:

    - discussing home working arrangements
    - making sure youâ€™ve the right equipment, for example, remote access to work systems
    - including you in all necessary communications
    - looking after your physical and mental wellbeing

    This will apply to many different types of businesses, particularly for employees who would have typically worked in offices or on-site.

    If your employer is not taking all practical steps to promote social distancing, you can report this to your local authority, or the [Health and Safety Executive](https://www.hse.gov.uk/) who can take a range of actions, including requiring your employer to take additional steps where appropriate.
