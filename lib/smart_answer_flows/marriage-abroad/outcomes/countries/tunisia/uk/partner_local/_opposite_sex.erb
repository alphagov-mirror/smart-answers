Contact the [Embassy of Tunisia](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Tunisia](/foreign-travel-advice/tunisia) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You need to swear an affirmation or affidavit that says you’re legally allowed to get married.

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %>. You can pay:

- in British pounds by Visa or Mastercard
- in the [local currency](/government/publications/tunisia-consular-fees) in cash

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Tunis](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-tunis/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker) to swear your affirmation or affidavit.

You need to bring your: 

- birth certificate
- passport
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll
- partner's passport or ID card

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed


%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
