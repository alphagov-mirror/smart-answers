  The visa you need depends on your partner or family member’s situation.

  ## They’re a British citizen

  In most cases, you should apply for a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor-visa).

  You should [apply for a ‘Surinder Singh’ EEA family permit](/family-permit/surinder-singh) instead if you’ve been living with them in an EEA country other than the UK and they’ve been working, self-employed, self-sufficient or studying there.

  ## They’re from elsewhere in the EEA

  Apply for a [family permit](/family-permit).

  ## They’re from outside the EEA

  Apply for a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor-visa).
