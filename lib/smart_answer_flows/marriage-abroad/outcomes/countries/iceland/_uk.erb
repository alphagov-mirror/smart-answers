##Before you start

You must contact the District Commissioner (‘Sýslumaðurinn’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need. Under Icelandic law District Commissioners make their own decisions about the documents needed.

^You should get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Iceland](/foreign-travel-advice/iceland) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

###Certificate of no impediment

You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage. A CNI costs £35.

Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in
[Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern
Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of
Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry),
[Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or
[Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

You’ll need to take [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.

Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.

Your CNI won’t expire if it was issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. CNIs issued in Scotland expire after 3 months. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the [Isle of
Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

A CNI is generally valid for 2 months under Icelandic law but you should check this period of validity with the District Commissioner where you intend to marry.

You should check with the District Commissioner whether they will accept the UK-issued CNI or whether you need to exchange your UK-issued CNI for a local version issued by the British Embassy in Reykjavik.

If the District Commissioner accepts a UK-issued CNI you should check with the District Commissioner whether it needs to be [legalised](/get-document-legalised).

You can [make an appointment to exchange your UK issued CNI for a local one](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-reykjavik/exchange-a-certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker) if the District Commissioner asks you to get one from the British Embassy in Reykjavik. This costs £50.  You can pay by credit card or in cash in Iceland and payment must be in the local currency.

You should check with the local authorities in Iceland to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of other documents.

The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).

###No trace letter

You may be asked to provide a ‘no trace letter’ by the District Commissioner. You can get a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office. ‘No trace letters’ cost £50 for each 10 year period from age 16 or when you entered the UK. Specify how many years you need the search to cover and quote reference ‘SEARCH 123’. It can take up to 3 weeks for a ‘no trace letter’ to be issued.

If you are in Scotland, you can get a ’to whom it may concern’ letter from the [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/getting-married-abroad/what-documents-will-i-need-to-provide).

If you are in Northern Ireland, you can get a ‘certificate of legal capacity to marry’ or a ‘marriage index search’ from [nidirect](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/marriage-outside-uk).

##Get married

You’ll need to give your CNI or no trace letter to the District Commissioner’s office.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Iceland
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You won’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate, you can apply for them at the Registers Iceland (‘Þjóðskrá’), telephone +354 515 5300.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
