    ## Get your employer to make arrangements for you to work safely

    Clinically vulnerable individuals are at higher risk of severe illness (for example, people with pre-existing conditions). Therefore, theyâ€™ve been asked to take extra care in observing social distancing and should be helped to work from home, either in their current role or in an alternative role.

    If clinically vulnerable (but not extremely clinically vulnerable) individuals cannot work from home, they should be offered the option of the safest available on-site roles, enabling them to stay 2 metres away from others.

    If they have to spend time within 2 metres of others, employers should carefully assess whether this involves an acceptable level of risk. As for any workplace risk, employers must take into account specific duties to those with protected characteristics, including, for example, pregnant women who are entitled to a suspension on full pay if suitable roles cannot be found.
