## Who should be on site and who should work remotely

Only essential staff should be on site and people who can’t work from home, for example because they need specialist equipment or you need them for safety or regulatory issues.

### Staff working on site

You should:

- minimise the number of people on site
- make sure on-site staff can [spot symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/)
- workers with symptoms must [quarantine immediately](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/what-to-do-if-you-or-someone-you-live-with-has-coronavirus-symptoms/staying-at-home-if-you-or-someone-you-live-with-has-coronavirus-symptoms/)
- when people return to work on site explain new procedure and provide training where necessary

### Staff working remotely

Everyone who can should work from home. Clinically [extremely vulnerable people](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#who-is-clinically-extremely-vulnerable) or [vulnerable people](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing#clinically-vulnerable-people) should always work from home.

You should:

- provide the right equipment for people to work from home
- keep remote and on site staff connected
- send updates to staff when the situation changes
- make sure disabled workers and new and expectant mothers can do their work from home (you have a responsibility to [prevent discrimination at work](https://www.gov.uk/employer-preventing-discrimination)
