You can pay by Mastercard or Visa credit card. Cash is accepted in some circumstances.

If you do not have a credit card of your own, the embassy will accept a credit
card payment from a friend or relative. They should fill in and sign the
[credit card authorisation form](/government/publications/passport-credit-debit-card-payment-authorisation-slip-austria)
and attach a copy of their passport or ID card. You should then bring this with
you to your appointment.
