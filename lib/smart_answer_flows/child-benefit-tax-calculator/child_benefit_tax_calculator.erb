<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  Use this tool to get an estimate of:

  - how much Child Benefit you receive in a tax year
  - the High Income Child Benefit tax charge you or your partner may have to pay
<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :post_body do %>
  You may be affected by the tax charge if your income is over £50,000. Income includes taxable benefits you get from your job, like a company car or medical insurance.

  Your partner is responsible for paying the tax charge if their income is more than £50,000 and higher than yours.

  You’ll need the dates Child Benefit started and, if applicable, [Child Benefit stopped](/child-benefit/eligibility).
