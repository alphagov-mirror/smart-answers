  Calculate Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for your employee.

  ##What you need to know

  You’re only responsible for paying SSP if:

  - you pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions for your employee (or would do if not for their age or their level of earnings)
  - your employee was sick for 4 or more days in a row (including non-working days)
  - your employee has told you they’re sick within your own time limit (or 7 days if you do not have one)

  ^ You cannot use the calculator for periods of sickness before 6 April 2011.^

  *[SSP]: Statutory Sick Pay
  
  ###Different periods of sick leave

  You can combine periods of sick leave if the gap between them is 8 weeks or less. These are called ‘linked Periods of Incapacity for Work (PIW)’.

  If there’s more than one linked PIW, you’ll need to [work out the SSP manually](/guidance/statutory-sick-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments#link-period-of-incapacity-for-work).
