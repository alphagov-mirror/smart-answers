## If someone had symptoms

Follow the [specific instructions for cleaning after a case of COVID-19](/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings).

### Handwashing, hand sanitiser and toilets

You should:

- use signs and posters with instructions for employees to wash their hands for 20 seconds as often as possible, to avoid touching their faces and to catch coughs and sneezes in tissues

- keep them free of all personal items, such as clothes, towels and toiletries
- clean them more often and more thoroughly during and at the end of the day, including lockers

### Handling goods, equipment, merchandise and vehicles

There may be a risk of the virus coming into the workplace through goods, merchandise or vehicles.

You should:

- make sure workers handling goods and merchandise know to wash their hands more often
- provide more handwashing facility if possible and hand sanitiser, if not
- have a process for cleaning goods and merchandise coming into the workplace or onsite

  ##Factories – cleaning the workplace

### Before you reopen

You should:

- check if you need to service or adjust ventilation systems, for example they shouldn’t  automatically reduce ventilation when there are fewer people on site
- get advice from your heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) engineer if your systems serve several buildings and you’re not sure if they need adjusting

Positive pressure systems can operate as normal.

### Once you’re open 

You should:

- frequently clean objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, such as door handles, pump handles and printers
- clean parts of shared equipment that you touch after each use, such as tools and vehicles, for example pallet trucks, forklift trucks
- clean goods and vehicles that come on to the site
- take special care when cleaning portable toilets
