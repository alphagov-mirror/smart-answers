    ## Get your employer to make arrangements for you to work safely

    Clinically vulnerable people are at higher risk of severe illness (for example, people with pre-existing conditions). Therefore, you should take extra care in observing social distancing. Your employer should help you to work from home, either in your current role or in an alternative role.

    If you are clinically vulneralbe (but not extremely clinically vulnerable) and cannot work from home, your employer should offer you the option of the safest available on-site roles, enabling you to stay 2 metres away from others.

    If you have to spend time within 2 metres of others, employers should carefully assess whether this involves an acceptable level of risk. As for any workplace risk, employers must take into account specific duties to those with protected characteristics, including, for example, pregnant women who are entitled to a suspension on full pay if suitable roles cannot be found.
