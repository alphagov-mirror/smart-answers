  Guidance for parents who’s children can’t yet go back to school.

  How do we determine if they can put their child back in childcare or school?

  Childcare and schools open to children of key workers and vulnerable children (as they have been so far)

  From june 1st schools are to open for reception, year 1 and year 6. And nurseries, childminders and other early years settings are to open too.

  There will be some face-to-face support for year 10 and year 12 students who are due to take key exams next year, but not full time.
