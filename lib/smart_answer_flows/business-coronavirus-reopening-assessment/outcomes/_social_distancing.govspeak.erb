## Social distancing on site

### General guidelines for social distancing

You should:

- stay 2 meters apart from other employees and customers
- put up signs to remind people to social distance
- keep the number of people on site to a minimum

Where you can’t stay 2 meters apart, for example you have fixed equipment or the space is small:

- only work together up to 15 minutes at a time
- wash hands and clean surfaces regularly
- use screens and barriers to separate people where possible
- work side by side or back-to-back rather than face-to-face
- have fixed teams to minimise exposure

### Entrances and exits

You should:

- stagger arrival and departure times
- open more entrances and exits to the site
- use screens in reception areas
- mark a one-way flow where possible
- provide hand washing facilities or hand sanitizer
- provide additional parking
- provide facilities to help people cycle, run, walk to work, for example bike racks
- make sure people touch as little as possible, for example deactivate turnstyles, keypads etc.

### Moving around the site

You should:

- close off areas that aren’t essential
- reduce the number of people using lifts by having markings on the floor
- put up signs to use stairs instead of lifts whenever possible
- keep workstations 2 meters apart where possible
- avoid sharing workstations, for example by assigning staff to one role
- avoid people passing objects, for example by having drop-off stations
- have a dedicated space for each team - you might have to change the layout of your site
- ask people to store personal items in lockers where possible
- regulate the use of corridors, lifts etc, for example with markings on the floor
- makes sure transport around the site isn’t crowded and drivers are protected
- stagger break times and have breaks outdoor where possible
- use freed up space from people working remotely to create break areas
- arrange seating in break areas 2 meters apart
- provide packaged meals instead of opening the canteen
- have 2 meter floor markings where people queue, for example toilets, changing rooms and other common areas

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and face covers

Staff don’t have to wear PPE on site. COVID-19 can be managed by social distancing, hygiene and minimising contact. The only exceptions are hospitals and clinical environments where the risk is high. PPE should be reserved for people who work in those environments.

Face covering is not required by law. Evidence shows that the effect is small. If staff choose to wear it make sure they [wear face covering safely](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering/how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering).

### Emergencies and social distancing

Helping someone in an emergency takes priority over social distancing. If possible, wait for the emergency services to arrive. After helping someone, wash your hands thoroughly and wash your clothes.
