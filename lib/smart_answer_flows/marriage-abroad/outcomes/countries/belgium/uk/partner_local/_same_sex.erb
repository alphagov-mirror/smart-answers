Same-sex relationships in Belgium that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:

- marriage
- ’cohabitation légale’, ’wettelijke samenwoning’, or ’gesetzliches zusammenwohnen’ (’statutory cohabitation’)

Contact the relevant local authorities in Belgium to find out about local marriage laws, including [what documents you’ll need](/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-belgium#proof-of-address-and-identity).

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the travel advice for Belgium before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You'll be asked to provide a 'certificate of custom and law for marriage' (‘certificate de coutume’ or ‘certificaat van gewoonterecht’) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You need to apply by post. Your certificate will then be posted to you within 10 working days.

If your partner is British, they also need to get a certificate. You can send both applications in the same envelope. You'll still need to pay 2 application fees, but you'll only be charged once for the postage of your certificates.

s3. Post your application and supporting documents to the British Consulate General Brussels. Write your own address on the envelope too - this is where you’ll be sent your certificate.
