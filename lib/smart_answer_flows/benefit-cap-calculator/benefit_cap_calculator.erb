<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  
The [benefit cap](/benefit-cap) limits the total amount of benefit you can get. It applies to most people aged 16 or over who have not reached [State Pension age](/state-pension-age).

  This calculator gives an estimate of how much your benefit might be capped.

  ^You can't check if you're affected by the benefit cap if you're claiming [Universal Credit](/universal-credit).^

  To use the calculator you’ll need to know the amounts of each benefit you get, and the number of people in your household.

  Your household includes you, your partner and any children that you’re responsible for and who live with you.
