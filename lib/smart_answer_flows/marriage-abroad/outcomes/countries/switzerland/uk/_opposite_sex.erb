##Before you start

s1. Contact the Civil Register Office where you’re getting married to find out about the availability of dates, local laws and what documents you’ll need.
s2. Contact the [Swiss Embassy in London](https://www.eda.admin.ch/london) to start the marriage process.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/publications/switzerland-list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Switzerland](/foreign-travel-advice/switzerland) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You need to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you're allowed to marry in Switzerland.

### Get a CNI

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage. It costs £35 to give notice and £35 for the CNI.
 
^Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)^
 
You’ll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.
 
Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.
 
If your CNI was issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, it will usually be valid at the town hall for 6 months. If it was issued in Scotland, it will expire after 3 months. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)
 
You’ll need to get your CNI [legalised](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).
 
You’ll also need to get a certified translation of your CNI. Use an [approved translator](/government/publications/switzerland-list-of-translators-and-interpreters).

##Naturalisation of your partner

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

*[CNI]: certificate of no impediment
